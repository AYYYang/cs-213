memory leaks:
1) in helper.c, many integer instances are created by calling integer_create, and using malloc allocating memory but never freed.
2) in integer.c many integer instances are created, and using malloc allocating memory but never freed.
3) in set_empty, pointers are set to NULL, but the memory is not freed 

Solution: 
use reference count to keep track of pointers and free the memory in the set_empty method
